# TypeScript import refactoring burguer

While VSCode haven't the auto reimport files on folder change or renaming for refactoring situations, this script will help.

This script was a write in a fastcode mode, just to solve a specify problem of file import refactoring. The code was write to be not maintainable, if there's something going wrong on this, all the code must be thrown away and then, a new plugin must be rewrite without the problems.
